# GO-LEARN

Scripts provided by [Go By Example](https://gobyexample.com/), but augmented by me. The purpose of this repo is to provide a starting point for those completely new to GO, but not completely new to programming. 

My augmentations are largely just attempts to apply the lesson in more complicated ways, or using different data types. Feel free to add your own examples.
